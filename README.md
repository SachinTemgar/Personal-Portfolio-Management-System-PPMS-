The Personal Portfolio Management System (PPMS) is a financial dashboard designed for students and early professionals who need clarity, not complexity. It bridges the gap between your assets and your aspirations by allowing you to set clear goals, link specific investments or savings accounts directly to them, and track your progress through an intuitive, visual interface. PPMS empowers you to make informed financial decisions with confidence.
